                                Devil May Cry is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_and_slash">hack-n-shlash</a>
                             game where your primary objective is to clear
                            waves of devils in order to complete a level. This game also includes different types
                            of puzzles that you can enjoy or even make you stuck in a certain level. What make
                            this game fun is its' combo mechanics. Mixing light and heavy attacks along with your
                            analog stick to do a satisfying combo depending on your style. This series got five game releases
                            which never fails to give you a very impressive gameplay, huge bosses and epic story line.

                                Fighting games are everywhere, in the arcades, consoles or even in your smart phones. 
                                Not a lot of gamers appreciate this genre for some reasons, but for me, i'll buy
                                and play every game i see in the store. There three fighting games that i've been playing
                                a lot recently. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekken">Tekken</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter">Street Fighter</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_or_Alive_(franchise)">Dead or Alive</a>.
                                Though they are different games with different deveolopers,they still share alot of fighting game mechanics.
                                Mixing LOW, MIDDLE, HIGH Puches or Kicks to do a very satisfying "10 HIT!" combo to defeat your friends or other people online.
                                Execute your SPECIAL MOVES to seal your overwelming victory!
                            </p>

                                If you like this type of Games i recommend: Tekken series, Street Fighter series, Dead or Alive series and Guilty Gear series.

                                MOBA is one of the most popular genre right now around the globe. MOBA is everywhere,
                                in your computers, mobile phones and consoles. Because of this genre and other competivive players,
                                E-sports was stablished and it is dominated with the most popular MOBA game titles such as DOTA 2, League of Legends
                                and Overwatch. I started playing MOBA years ago and i found them pretty hard to master. There are a lot of creative Characters
                                you can use in order to create a dream team setup for you to win a match. They have classes such as Carries, Tanks,
                                Supports and Mages. Capture the main objectives and proper team work is the key victory in this genre. So if you are 
                                into MOBAs, i recommend you my three favorite MOBA games, League of Legends, Battlerite, Overwatch.

                                to find your own ways to complete all the objectives and do it with your own style. Watch Dogs is

                                complete a mission by hacking different things by your own advantage. Most Open World games have huge cast of 
                                Characters that you can communicate or interact with for your mission or side missions. Just like in the movies,
                                they have character developments as the story goes by.
